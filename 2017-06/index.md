## Notes

* Our first meetup!
* Started with a little intro, shared the slack group signup address. Also asked roughly where people were working. Couple people working for Leiden companies, handful working remotely from Leiden. Majority seemed to be commuting to Amsterdam and the Hague.
* Stefano kicked off our first meetup with his introduction GraphQL.
* Lots of engagement and questions after the talk.
* ~20 attendees
* expense for the sponsor, for food and drinks: a bit less than 250 euros

## Presenter

### Stefano Masini

* Talk: How to write a GraphQL server
* Description: GraphQL is a new protocol for exchanging information between client (browser, mobile) and server (any language) that improves and solves the limitations of REST. It was invented at Facebook and it's already been widely adopted by many companies (GitHub just to name one). I will show you what it looks like, highlight the benefits and give you an idea of what it means to implement it.

## Reflection

* Venue: [Hubspot](http://hubspotleiden.nl) were kind enough to provide a space free of charge. The space was on the 3rd floor next to the cafeteria which was available for drinks/snacks after the talk. No beamer but a large TV which turned out to be fine. They even put out signs pointing people to the space which helped a lot. Accessibility was awkward, the only elevator available required someone at hubspot with a key to open when we needed it.
* Presentation: Great talk from Stefano. People engaged positively so it seemed to work well as a generalist topic. Lots of questions afterwards and continued discussion over drinks/snacks.
* General: Really positive feedback from everyone who attended. People seem excited for a good meetup that doesn't involve traveling to Amsterdam.
* Next time:
  * Prepare intro a little more.
  * Consider asking if people have any announcements or job openings they'd like to promote.
  * Consider a venue with better accessibility.
