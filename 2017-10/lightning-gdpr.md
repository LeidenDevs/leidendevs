## General Data Protection Regulation: Highlights

In may 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation will replace the current data protection directive 95/46/ec. I would like to discuss some aspects of this new regulation. Primarily because it will have tremendous consequences for a wide range of IT projects. First more data will be labeled 'personal' and the rules directing how to handle personal data will be significantly more strict. Second, privacy by design will be legaly required in every project. Finally the fine for a company making a transgressions can amount to five percent of the yearly revenue. All in all sufficient reason to discuss this with people who work with sensitive data on a daily basis.
