Retrospective
===

- Stefano
  - we totally forgot to record the talk!!! I should have used my phone to capture it.
  - I think it went well, good quality talk, very nice location, interested people with relevant questions.
  - But there was a high no-show rate: about 35 people signed up but less than 20 actually showed up (did I count right?). So I wonder why and what we could have done better.
  - I think we should have sent out an email reminder that the even was taking place.
  - We might have announced more properly that there would have been food, because it might have helped people remember.
  - Food: it was great! But the single-portion packaging makes it tricky: hungry people cannot compensate for non hungry ones, so there's a lot of waste, and if we order too little we risk leaving someone without food. In contrast, at the first event we had small bytes, so people could choose to have 1, 0, 2, many. In other (larger) meetups I've seen food served in catering style. That also helps, because you can try to adjust the served quantities. But an actual catering is complicated and costly. I've also seen a more home-style approach with a bunch of take away trays open on a self-serve table, and people serve themselves on plates. This could be a possible intermediate approach, low cost but flexible. A bit messy though.
  - Communication: I think we did a poor job. We failed to updated the meetup page in a timely manner, and, as I said, we didn't send out email reminders, which can help people remember. I think that was due to the fact that we, the organizers, had a very late confirmation about the food options and the actual abstract of the talk. And that, in turn, was due to summer, vacations, apps not collaborating, etc. No blame here, just stating the facts. I think, in the future, we should apply a stricter policy about deadlines to submit talk abstracts and set up the event trivia with the host.
